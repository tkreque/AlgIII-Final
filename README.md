# AlgIII-Final

Code design for the class "Algorithm III" in java.
Is an attempt to use the Huffman algorithm to convert files in binary.

There's some issues:
 - New lines are not considered in the return of the binary string to text, grouping all in 1 line.
 - The code don't compress the text. (The code simple convert the string into other string looking like binary, is not actual binary)
 
The package "my" is my code.
The package "web" is the algorithm in this youtube video, that help me to understand the how-to.

My variables are in Brazilian Portuguese, I'll try to convert into english to simplify.

This code was used only for academic purpose and is the first version.
Thanks
